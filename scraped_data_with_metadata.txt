Climate Change Conferences (COP)
ICIEC's active involvement in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conferences (COP) reflects its deep commitment to addressing global climate challenges. Since its first participation at COP22 in Marrakech in 2016, where ICIEC organized a high-profile panel discussion under the theme “ECA Risk Mitigation in Renewable Energy Investments,” the organization has consistently played a pivotal role in these conferences. The panel at COP22 provided a prime platform to highlight the benefits that ICIEC, in collaboration with its partners, extends to Host Countries, Investors, Lenders, and Contractors in renewable energy projects. This event marked the beginning of ICIEC's robust engagement in global climate dialogues.
At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, ICIEC's presence further cemented its role as a key player in the climate action sphere. The momentum continued at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh in 2022, where ICIEC's participation was not only active but also impactful. The conference saw ICIEC co-organizing three timely side events and three fireside chats, fostering discussions and insights into critical climate issues. A significant highlight was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), focusing on delivering mark-to-market Climate Action projects in African Member States. This partnership leverages ICIEC’s expertise in de-risking solutions, demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable development in Africa. 
The COP28 in Dubai, UAE, held on November 30, 2023, was another landmark event for ICIEC. It marked the launch of the groundbreaking Climate Change Policy, a testament to ICIEC’s dedication to mainstreaming the de-rsking of transactions and projects that combat Climate Changeinto its core operations. Furthermore, ICIEC's agreement to join the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform, managed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), underscores its proactive approach to supporting energy transition initiatives. The side events hosted by ICIEC at COP28 addressed vital topics in climate finance and mitigation, contributing valuable insights and solutions to the global climate conversation. 
Looking ahead to COP29, scheduled for November 11-24, 2024, in Azerbaijan, ICIEC is poised for active participation. As the event will be held in one of ICIEC's Member States, it presents a unique opportunity for ICIEC to showcase its initiatives, share its experiences, and further its commitment to climate action on an international stage. The conference will serve as a platform for ICIEC to continue its influential role in shaping global climate policies and strategies, particularly in areas related to renewable energy investments and sustainable development. 
ICIEC's involvement in COP29 and beyond is expected to not only reinforce its position as a leader in climate risk mitigation and sustainable finance but also to foster new partnerships and collaborative efforts. The organization's ongoing engagement in these pivotal conferences is a clear indication of its resolve to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat climate change and promote a sustainable future. ICIEC's contributions and insights are anticipated to play a significant role in driving meaningful discussions and actions at COP29 and in shaping the global response to climate challenges.

Overview
An alarming 9.2% of the global population, which translates to approximately 735 millionindividuals, are enduring chronic hunger*. To meet the ambitious yet crucial goal of eradicating hunger by 2030, acting quickly and cohesively is imperative. Recognizing this urgency, the international community has pinpointed the development of sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices as a pivotal measure for reducing global malnutrition.Consequently, we must channel increased and strategically targeted investments into infrastructure and technologies that amplify agricultural productivity and food security.

At ICIEC, our role as a Multilateral Development Organization compels us to take meaningful actions to bolster our Member States economic, social, and environmental well-being. In the face of the unparalleled crisis resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, our commitment to tackling emerging challenges remains stronger.
ICIEC has been a steadfast advocate for the agricultural sector among its 49 Member States for nearly three decades. Anchored by a resolute commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the organization aims to spark enduring economic development within its membership. Our strategic emphasis on SDG 2 (Zero hunger) leads to this commitment, which informs ICIEC’s focus on transactions that improve food security through insured food-related activities.

Since its inception, ICIEC’s unwavering support has translated into vital contributions, amounting to a significant USD 1.5 billion within the Agriculture sector. This considerable effort has notably boosted productivity and income for food producers, particularly in the least developed countries. The scope of our support is wide-ranging, from enabling the import of essential food commodities to empowering the mechanization systems of agriculture in member states.
By extending comprehensive protection to exporters dealing in agricultural goods, technologies, and equipment, ICIEC empowers them to navigate even the most challenging markets with unwavering confidence. This approach enables exporters to maintain consistent cash flows, expanding their operations in markets that would otherwise be perceived as high-risk. Furthermore, ICIEC provides tailored insurance solutions to banks in the Member States, specifically designed for clients seeking to import essential goods and services as inputs for agricultural activities. This strategic approach fosters an environment conducive to agricultural growth and productivity enhancement.

ICIEC COVID-19
At the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC), we are deeply concerned about the tragic human losses, the socio-economic disruptions, and the strain on Member Countries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ICIEC expresses solidarity with our 50 Member States and has been working closely with the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) group and the Corporation’s deep network of partners to bolster capacity for Member States’ recovery.

ICIEC provides credit and political risk insurance to sustain imports of strategic commodities, to ensure investment protection, and to minimize volatility.

ICIEC and IsDB Response
Learn about the IsDB Group’s ‘Strategic Preparedness and Response Program’ and ICIEC’s contribution to sustaining trade and investment during the crisis.
Strategic Preparedness and Response Programme (SPRP)
IsDB Group fully recognizes the limited ability and capacity of its Member Countries to cope with the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and assures them of the Group’s full and unwavering support to get through the crisis together and build back for a better tomorrow.

ICIEC has developed partnership initiatives with IsDB Group Entities to better serve Member Countries and support their recovery from the negative impact of COVID-19. To do so,
IsDB Group has allocated US $2.3 billion of aid to its member countries and to Muslim communities in non-member countries under the Strategic Preparedness and Response Program (SPRP) to combat the health and socio-economic effects of COVID-19. This aid package will be crucial in helping member states respond to the virus, restore normalcy and restart their economies, achieving IsDB’s “3 Rs”.
The IsDB COVID-19 Response “3 Rs”:
IsDB has established a response plan to cover 3 phases of recovery for the short-term, medium-term, and long-term.

R1
Respond: Deliver immediate action through South-South and North-South reverse linkage operations focused on a) strengthening health systems to provide care to the infected; b) building production capacity of testing kits and vaccines; and c) building Pandemic Preparedness capacity in cooperation with G20 Global Initiative.
R2
Restore: Deliver medium term action through financing for trade and SMEs to sustain activity in core strategic value chains, and to ensure continuity of the necessary supplies mainly to the health and food sectors, and for other essential commodities.
R3
Restart: Deliver long-term action to build resilient economies on solid foundations and catalyze private investment by supporting economic recovery and countercyclical spending, with a targeted US $10 billion that aims to unlock $1 trillion USD worth of investments.

Project Highlights
ICIEC has contributed to a number of projects that have promoted the “3 R” action plan, enabling countries to combat COVID-19, construct and sustain healthcare facilities, maintain the flow of goods, and secure investments for continued growth.
1. ICIEC covers SMBC financing to Egyptian Ministry of Finance
As part of ICERI, ICIEC recently extended USD 30 million in cover for a Bank Master Policy with Kuwait Finance House. The financing is being used by Egypt’s Ministry of Finance to import crude oil and refined petroleum. The transaction is part of an open syndication with ICIEC’s IsDB Group sister entity, ITFC, and is working to ease the financial burden on the Egypt and mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic.
2.ICIEC coverage through ICERI supports essential energy imports to Tunisia
Under ICERI, ICIEC has recently provided USD 19 million in Bank Master Policy coverage to BMCE Bank of Africa Morocco, allowing their participation in an ITFC syndication facility. The coverage supports the import of fossil fuels to Tunisia’s state-owned electricity production, transport and distribution centre, Société Tunisienne de l’Electricite et du Gaz (STEG). This transaction is assisting the mitigation of the COVID-19 implications by ensuring Tunisian citizens have sufficient access to energy.
3.Rehabilitation of a wastewater collector in Dakar, Senegal
ICIEC is providing EUR 50 million in guarantee cover as part of a EUR 126 million facility to Société Générale. The facility is being used to rehabilitate the Hann-Famm wastewater collector in Dakar, Senegal which was built more than 70 years ago and is an advanced stage of degradation. The collector provides approximately 8 km of evacuation and treatment of wastewater, covering more than 10 districts of the city. The rehabilitation will significantly improve the city’s wastewater security, enhancing resilience against sanitation-related health issues for the population, especially during flood season. A more effective wastewater collector will also increase the attractiveness of the city of Dakar for foreign direct investment.
4.ICIEC insurance supports access to energy in Tunisia
ICIEC provided USD 4.75 million toward a Bank Master Policy, allowing European based bank, CHAABI, to participate in a syndication led by ITFC. ICIEC’s cover for CHAABI is supporting the annual import of gas products to Société Tunisienne de l’Electricite et du Gaz (STEG), Tunisia’s state-owned electricity production, transport and distribution centre. This transaction is essential as it is enabling access to energy for Tunisian citizens. The coverage was provided through ICERI
5.Supporting imports of essential commodities to Pakistan
ICIEC has provided USD 50 million in coverage under the Bank Master Policy to the Arab Investment Company for the importation of essential commodities, such as crude oil, refined products, and liquified natural gas. The commodities are critical to Pakistan’s residential, commercial and industrial sectors for diverse purposes, including heating, cooking, generating electricity and manufacturing a wide variety of products.
6.ICIEC Insurance Expands Côte d’Ivoire Health Sector
Thanks to ICIEC’s cover of EUR 124 million for a Deutsche Bank investment, the people of ICIEC member Côte d’Ivoire will have greater access to hospitals and healthcare services. Two new hospitals with a collective capacity of 400 beds will be built in the south-eastern towns of Adzope and Aboisso, bringing state of the art equipment and facilities to this underserved region. The two hospitals will employ around 600 local people and foster the development of a micro-economy in the areas surrounding them. Additionally, the project will finance five new medical units in existing hospitals across the country. The project EPC will be conducted by a Moroccan contractor, supporting the export of services from another ICIEC member country and facilitating intra-OIC trade of services and human capital between Cote d’Ivoire and Morocco. The support from ICIEC will help Côte d’Ivoire achieve its National Development Plan targets for 2016-2020 while also improving the Republic’s ability to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
7.ICIEC Extends Coverage for the Purchase of High-end Medical Equipment to Hospitals in Punjab, Pakistan
ICIEC recently extended USD 2.3 million, the extent of the Corporation’s line limit, in non-payment insurance to support the supply and installation of state-of-the-art CT scan equipment to District Headquarters hospitals in Punjab, Pakistan. This project will greatly assist the Pakistani healthcare sector in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic by providing doctors with a more cost effective and accurate method for diagnosing patients. The project was funded as part of an ongoing program with the Government of Punjab to improve the lack of essential medical diagnostic equipment in the province. ICIEC’s involvement in the transaction also directly supports the Punjab Health Reforms Roadmap, initiated in April 2014, to improve the quality of healthcare facilities in Pakistan’s most populous province.
8.ICIEC Cover Enables the Construction and Rehabilitation of Schools in Côte d’Ivoire
ICIEC has provided EUR 20 million in Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligation cover against the non-payment of a loan facility provided to the Government of Côte d’Ivoire. ICIEC’s cover enables the government to move forward with the renovation of the Scientific High School of Yamoussoukro in addition to advancing the construction of 22 new classrooms. The project is part of a general social program that the Government of Côte d’Ivoire is implementing. The program aims to mitigate poverty and illiteracy by enabling as many children as possible to have access to quality education.
9.ICIEC provides cover for financing of essential imports to Nigeria in response to COVID-19
ICIEC has provided USD 12.5 million in cover, issuing the Corporation’s first ever BMP Murabaha to BMCE Bank of Africa Morocco in support of its financing for a Nigerian bank. ICIEC’s support allowed for the urgent financing to secure essential imports of food and refined oil to Nigeria, helping to offset the social and economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ICIEC has played a crucial role in facilitating trade flow and reinforcing trust, directly supporting banks and private sector resilience through the crisis.
10.ICIEC support provides essential commodities to the Government of Egypt
ICIEC has provided USD 16 million under a Documentary Credit Insurance Policy to French international bank, Société Générale, for the importation of essential commodities to Egypt. ICIEC’s contribution is essential as the facility was allocated in response to the Government of Egypt’s call to the international market for a more secure and steady supply of strategic commodities to help Egypt in the fight against the economic and social impact of COVID-19.
11.Securing essential imports of wheat to enhance food security in Bangladesh
ICIEC is supplying USD 17.1 million in coverage under ICERI to one of the leading private commercial banks in Bangladesh, the State Bank of India (SBI). The transaction serves to directly respond to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting the importation of vital wheat imports into the country at subsidized cost, enhancing food security for the citizens of Bangladesh. This transaction directly contributes to the achievement of SDG 2: Zero hunger in ICIEC’s member country.
12.ICIEC insurance supports financing for Senegal’s urgent strategic commodities
ICIEC has recently extended USD 9 million in LC confirmation insurance to BMCE Bank of Africa Morocco through ICERI, in order to secure urgent imports of strategic commodities to Senegal. The COVID-19 pandemic, combined with flooding, has caused a serious supply chain disturbance and economic distress in the country. ICERI has eased the financial burden on the transaction by structuring a concessional all-in pricing mechanism, helping Senegal to preserve the flow of essential imports.
13.ICIEC covers ITFC syndication transaction for Kuwait Finance House
As part of ICERI, ICIEC recently extended USD 30 million in cover for a Bank Master Policy with Kuwait Finance House. The financing is being used by Egypt’s Ministry of Finance to import crude oil and refined petroleum. The transaction is part of an open syndication with ICIEC’s IsDB Group sister entity, ITFC, and is working to ease the financial burden on the Egypt and mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Official Message from the CEO on COVID-19
 jeddah

The global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has presented the OIC States with unprecedented challenges to the health of their citizens and economies. ICIEC and its partners have been working throughout the pandemic to provide aid and solutions to the Members States and their citizens, coordinating to find innovative responses to the ongoing challenges. While the spread of vaccines has brought hope for an end to the health crisis, the global economic recovery will require continued patience. During this time, ICIEC will continue the development and implementation of programs designed to mitigate risk and provide financial relief to the Member States by fostering trade and stimulating investment.

ICIEC looks forward to a brighter future, where the health and safety of our Members States’ citizens are secured, and economic stability is maintained. Through our efforts to rebuild and strengthen OIC trade and investment networks, we hope that the world will emerge from this crisis with more robust and resilient economies than ever before. As we restore trust in the landscape of global trade, ICIEC believes that by working together, we can build back better to create a more sustainable future for all.

Oussama Kaissi
CEO of the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC)

The SPRP funding is targeting interventions that focus on emergency preparedness and response
> To curb and contain the spread of the COVID-19.

> To build resilience of Member countries in responding to outbreaks and pandemics.

The program supports:
Strengthening of health systems.
Funding of national epidemic preparedness and response plans.
Community awareness and education.

ICIEC has actively contributed to the implementation of SPRP in cooperation with IsDB Group peers and succeeded in supporting Member States’ efforts combatting the pandemic with a total to date of USD 1,414 million in approved transactions. ICIEC’s cover is facilitating the import of emergency goods and necessities into Member States, such as medical equipment, food, wheat, milk powder, crude oil, and gas. In addition, ICIEC is providing insurance cover for critical infrastructure projects to support COVID-19 relief efforts, such as the construction of regional hospitals.

The COVID-19 Guarantee Facility
To encourage trade and investment during the COVID-19 pandemic, ICIEC and IsDB jointly launched the COVID-19 Guarantee Facility (CGF), an innovative program to support the financing of trade. The CGF also supports SMEs to sustain activity in core strategic value chains and ensure the continuity of necessary supplies, mainly to the health and food sectors, including vaccine procurement.

The CGF acts as a source of private capital funding through attracting additional participants to the IsDB funding structure. With ICIEC being the Guarantee Facility agent, the CGF will provide insurance protection against non-repayment events in line with the appetite of external partners through the issuance of adapted versions of the ICIEC Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligation (NHSFO) policies. The facility has been implemented by the two entities to support COVID-19 hit industries in the OIC Member States and to attract cross-border financing from international Banks in Member States.

The ICIEC-ISFD COVID-19 Emergency Response Initiative (ICERI)
ICIEC and the Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development (ISFD), have collaborated to create the ICIEC-ISFD COVID-19 Emergency Response Initiative (ICERI) program, a rapid COVID-19 response that employs an innovative financial structure, providing more confidence to suppliers, investors, and financiers of COVID-19 related transactions and extends some relief to the Member Countries on their borrowing costs. The mechanism involves a grant of USD 5 million provided by ISFD which ICIEC has been using as a subsidy for the premium charged to the Member States or as a first-loss cushion.

The program can mobilize up to USD 400 million for the procurement of urgent product needs:
Medical equipment, pharmaceutical products and other related items that are needed for the fight against the COVID-19. Including but not limited to, protective gear, testing kits, sanitizers, ventilators etc.
Essential commodity items, including essential food supplies and energy commodities
To date, USD 824 million worth of trade transactions has been supported by the ICERI program in the food and other essential commodities sectors, using only USD 1 million of the subsidies funded by ISFD. This reflects a leveraging of more than 150 times.
IsDB Group Vaccine Facility
As part of IsDB Group’s as part of SPRP 2.0, ICIEC is contributing to the IsDB Group Vaccine Initiative (IVAC), supporting Member Countries in accessing the COVID-19 vaccine. For it’s part, ICIEC is providing risk mitigation solutions to international financial institutions through its Credit and Political Risk Insurance products, facilitating additional resource mobilization from the international market.

Further ICIEC Response Efforts
Memorandums of Understanding:
ICIEC has signed several Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) with Export Credit Agencies ECAs throughout the pandemic. These partnerships facilitate flexible yet strong agreements for risk sharing in the form of reinsurance or co-insurance, supporting both parties to increase their risk appetite for trade transactions and investments. Through the expanded trade coverage supported by these partnerships, firms in member countries can access new markets, grow in existing markets, and in the process generate employment and economic growth.

During the pandemic, ICIEC signed MoUs with the following partner institutions:

Webinars:

ICIEC has engaged in webinars with key partners to roll out COVID-19 response measures and funding, discuss the impact of COVID-19 on IsDB member countries, and make plans for the continued support of those in need.

The webinar highlighted the importance of the investment and export credit insurance sector in covering risks for countries, local companies, and international trade partnerships.

Introducing AATB’s Investment Pillar to Financial Institutions and Partners: Building Investment Bridges Between Arab and African Countries: under the umbrella of the Arab-Africa Trade Bridge (AATB) program, ICIEC, the Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC), and the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), in collaboration with the IsDB Group Business Forum hosted this event to discuss key investment, trade and insurance pillars designed to improve trade between Arab and African countries.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the maximum amount that ICIEC can cover?

ICIEC’s maximum cover on its own books is limited by its risk appetite framework. However, it can cover larger transactions with reinsurance support. The amount covered depends on factors such as the obligor, risk type, obligor country, sector, portfolio mix, and the availability of reinsurance support for each transaction.
How does ICIEC re-insure itself for MLT export credit transactions?

ICIEC re-insures MLT (Medium and Long-Term) transactions through its own MT/FII Treaty book with a reputable panel of reinsurers or by facultative reinsurance placements in the private market, or a combination of both.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the maximum amount that ICIEC can cover?

ICIEC’s maximum cover on its own books is limited by its risk appetite framework. However, ICIEC can cover larger transactions and investments with reinsurance support. The amount covered depends on various factors including the obligor, risk type, obligor country, sector, portfolio mix, single risk limit, and the availability of reinsurance support for each transaction.
What risks can be covered under investment insurance? Please explain in particular your investment insurance policy that provides coverage for both borrower and country risks (comprehensive cover).

ICIEC covers political risks including Expropriation, FX inconvertibility and Transfer restrictions, Breach of Contract, War and Civil disturbance, and provides a credit enhancement solution for Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligations (NHSFO). The comprehensive cover protects against political risks and non-payment risk (NHSFO) where a sovereign is the obligor. It also applies to projects involving state-owned agencies or sub-sovereigns, covering political risks and commercial risks that may lead to default.
Would ICIEC be able to cover local costs (costs of a local construction company) in a project in an Islamic country?

Yes, ICIEC can cover local costs as long as they are part of an overall project that has a majority of foreign costs. Local costs cannot be covered on a stand-alone basis; there must be a cross-border flow of funds involved.
Would ICIEC be able to provide coverage for a loan to finance the cash payment (or down payment) required by ECAs under the OECD consensus? This cash or down payment is usually approximately 15% of the value of the exports to the ICIEC member country?

Yes, ICIEC can provide coverage, provided that the 15% down payment is part of a project. If it is solely for exports, the transaction cannot qualify for investment insurance cover.

================================================================================

Content:
Human Development
One of the priority development goals for ICIEC is to ensure the well-being and economic prosperity of member country populations. Human development efforts from ICIEC include underwriting projects that contribute to access to basic infrastructure and services, including health, nutrition, education and sanitation. Promoting access to these services inherently improves the well-being of and quality of life for member country citizens. In turn, these healthier populations are more productive and are better enabled to contribute back into their country’s economy.

Job Creation
ICIEC recognizes the opportunities presented by the growing working age population within OIC countries and the job creation concerns they face. Through supporting FDI and exporters and facilitating trade, ICIEC contributes to both creating new jobs and sustaining existing ones. As companies increase their exports, they scale up operations, leading to labor demand on the economy and more employment opportunities. ICIEC emphasizes supporting labor- intensive sectors where significant employment opportunities can be created.

Access to Infrastructure
Improving access to infrastructure is among the top priorities for ICIEC’s development impact. ICIEC’s multilateral and preferred creditor status make it an attractive partner for investors and stakeholders embarking on such projects. ICIEC also provides much needed insurance for financing large development projects, particularly in high risk investment countries where mobilizing large sources of finance can be risky without adequate mitigants.

Access to Basic Social Services
ICIEC is also committed to improving access to basic social services particularly health and water services. Supporting access to high quality health care promotes healthier lives for all OIC Member Countries’ citizens leading to higher productivity and overall economic growth. Improving access to water services is crucial for most OIC countries that have scarce water resources and are even more susceptible with climate change.

Access To Clean Water In Abidjan
ICIEC provided EUR 107 million for Non-Honoring of Financial Obligation Loan Guarantee to Société General Paris to support the construction of a water supply facility in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. Since 2002, rural to urban migration in Cote d’Ivoire has increased, placing high demand on the existing water supply. Prior to this project, the majority of the population relied on underground water, which is often unreliable and unsafe for consumption. ICIEC’s support for this project has significant human development impact, delivering clean water to nearly 2 million citizens and creating 450 jobs for local citizens. Moreover, the project allows for more sustainable management of the aquifer around Abidjan, preventing both the depletion and pollution of groundwater resources. The development of basic infrastructure such as water, sanitation and distribution facilities are crucial to achieving sustainable development and empowering communities in Ivory Coast.

COTUNACE — a valued partnership to expand the islamic finance sector
The Tunisian Company of Foreign Trade Insurance, COTUNACE, has been a key ECA partner for ICIEC in its mission of supporting Member Country exports. The Tunisian trade insurer offers products that protect Tunisian companies against outstanding payment risks and market disruption in international trade. COTUNACE has always maintained a privileged cooperation relationship with its Arab and international colleagues, in particular with ICIEC. Since first establishing a partnership in 2004, ICIEC and COTUNACE have jointly insured over USD 248 million in business. Over the years, ICIEC has become COTUNACE’s leading credit reinsurer, mainly in Sub-Saharan African countries. Partnership with ICIEC provides COTUNACE with additional guarantee capacity which enables it to engage more deeply with policyholders and cover destinations that are sometimes dicult to sell on the private reinsurance market, particularly the African market. The Cooperation’s clear development policy and commitment to non-competition with ECA’s sets it apart from other reinsurers or co-insurers. Additionally, ICIEC plays an important role in promoting, protecting and guaranteeing investments and markets as well as projects financed by IsDB on the basis of the Islamic Shariah in OIC Member Countries. While takaful credit insurance does not currently exist in Tunisia, COTUNACE recognizes there is strong potential for it to develop. As a pioneer in this field, ICIEC hopes to cultivate this market within the framework of a partnership relationship between insurance and reinsurance.

ICIEC provided USD 38 million in Documentary Credit Insurance Policy to the State Bank of India to support the importation of power generation equipment. Bangladesh’s growing population and expanding economic activity is increasing the country’s energy demand, fast outpacing supply capacity. Many areas of the country face regular blackouts.  The agriculture sector is hit hardest by the blackouts, resulting in serious underperformance of the Bengali economy relative to its potential agricultural outputs. ICIEC’s support for the project is bringing critical equipment needed to increase Bangladesh’s power generation capacity. Increased energy for the agriculture sector will in turn enhance food security and economic growth through increased exports of agricultural commodities.

Insurance As The Facilitator To Unlocking Market Access To The AfCFTA
While current global trade trends are pointing towards protectionism, African countries have made a concerted effort to deepen regional integration and expand trade. The ratification of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement signaled the strong commitment African countries have towards open trade. The free trade area has an ambition to create a unified continental market estimated at USD 3 trillion with over 1 billion people. However, to translate the AfCFTA from a trade agreement into a thriving free trade area will require significant financial resource mobilization to facilitate exports.
To realize the tremendous potential in the AfCFTA, given the existing high investment risk, will require the participation of institutions that offer investment insurance such as ICIEC. The insurance services offered will be crucial for the success of the AfCFTA in two main ways.
First, these investment insurance institutions provide much needed insurance to cover the political and commercial risks that might affect trade transactions. This insurance coverage provides investors with confidence that if the transaction does not follow through, they can at least get their initial investment back. This type of insurance will encourage more first mover investors in the AfCFTA. Second, the capacity building offered by ICIEC will be critical in building national institutions that support exports such as national Export Credit Agencies (ECA’s) and banks. Capacity building is essential in equipping these export-enabling institutions with the financial resources and technical capacity needed to facilitate exports in the AfCFTA. 
As AfCFTA signatories begin to negotiate the trade agreement they should also keep in mind that investment insurance will be the cornerstone in building an inclusive and thriving free trade area that will benefit all member states.

Promotion of Egypt’s energy sector
As a result of rising demand, inadequate generation and transmission capacity coupled with aging and insufficient investments in energy infrastructure, Egypt suffered from an acute shortage of power between 2014 and 2018. Daily 10-hour blackouts were common at the peak of the crisis in the summer of 2013, and in 2014 and 2015, power was cut to heavy industry, reducing Egypt’s private sector competitiveness. 
In 2015, the Egyptian Government introduced an emergency plan to double power generation capacity by 2020. ICIEC has underwritten the construction of gas power plants in Assiut, West Damietta Port Said, Hurgada and Sharm El Sheikh with a totaled installed capacity of 2,672MW. This served to stabilize the power grid and secure the base load. By providing stable electricity supplies to large industries with high voltage electricity needs, this investment will increase Egypt’s competitiveness. 
The government’s energy plan calls for Egypt to produce at least 20% of its energy from renewables by 2022 and as much as 40% by 2035 up from 3%. The  Benban Solar Complex, a 1.8GW project, consists of 30 separate solar plants being developed by different companies at a total cost of USD 4 billion and will generate enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses. ICIEC provided cover for Alcazar Energy which has constructed 4-50MW solar plants. The project is part of Egypt’s Nubian Suns Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (FiT) program announced in September 2014, which is in line with the Egyptian government’s Sustainable Energy Strategy 2035.

Supporting Climate Change Resilient Inrastructure Through Islamic Finance
Considering that many of ICIEC’s member countries are low-income and developing countries, they struggle to attract capital to mitigate or adapt to climate change, despite being some of the most vulnerable to its effects. As such, ICIEC understands its vital role in helping to drive investment into climate-resilient infrastructure in these member countries and is working consistently to improve its capacity as a climate finance provider. In addition to its covering of climate-resilient projects, ICIEC has begun building partnerships which will allow the Corporation to leverage its products more effectively and to crowd in private sector capital for climate related projects. The Corporation has also begun developing products tailored specifically for catalyzing investment towards climate-resilient projects.
Specifically, ICIEC introduced its Green Sukuk Insurance Policy, aimed at allowing Sukuk issuers to better attract capital for “green” projects. The product will be crucial for issuers in ICIEC’s vulnerable developing countries which may struggle with poor credit ratings. Fostering its climate finance partnerships, ICIEC signed an MoU with the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), aimed at facilitating sustainable energy investment into Morocco. Finally, ICIEC built up its climate finance capacity by having its representatives attend events aimed at strengthening the renewable energy sector. To this end, ICIEC representatives attended the North African Renewable Energy Summit 2019 and the 5th International Renewable Energy Agency Policy Day. ICIEC will continue to work towards being a leader in the space of climate finance to help avert or mitigate the threats that climate change poses for its Member Countries.

Export Sector Development
Export sector development is essential to growth in any economy and vital for any country to fully participate in global trade. The development impact reaches full potential as the export sector grows – more goods are sold, meaning income is generated, taxed and supplied to the government. This income can then be used to finance public projects that foster even further development in the country.
Increased Exports from Member Countries
Through the provision of its various export insurance products, ICIEC minimizes commercial and political risks involved in cross-border trade. ICIEC’s support to exporters and banks in facilitating trade between Member Countries and with the rest of the world. ICIEC also aims to facilitate and increase intra-OIC exports, encouraging businesses to take advantage of the diverse resources in Member Countries.
Enhanced Access to Markets
Accessing new markets can be daunting for exporters for a myriad of reasons including political risk and lack of available credit data. This perceived risk can lead to adverse effects on an exporter’s growth prospects. ICIEC’s products provide exporters with assurance when entering new and potentially riskier markets. ICIEC’s insurance is not only useful to firms seeking to access new markets but also for firms looking to increase exports and service delivery to their existing markets. Expansion in existing markets can also entail risks given the various economic, political and social uncertainties. The insurance ICIEC provides gives these firms the protection they need to expand their market share.
SME Integration into Export Markets/Value Chains
SMEs play a significant role in economic development and job creation both in developed and developing countries. However, in most OIC member countries,SMEs continue to face significant financing gaps. ICIEC has played a leading role in supporting SMEs in OIC Member Countries to integrate in export markets and value chains through underwriting SME loan facilities or insuring Letters of Credit for the importation of capital goods by SMEs to become more productive and competitive.
Increased Capacity of National ECAs
Many member countries have embarked on establishing their own national Export Credit Agencies (ECAs), often starting off with limited insurance and technical capacities—especially in developing countries. ICIEC provides capacity building and financial services to support these endeavours, closely cooperates with them, and provides additional insurance capacity through facultative and treaty re-insurance mechanisms. Increasing the capabilities of these ECAs allows them to provide support to businesses in parallel with ICIEC’s offerings, facilitating even more exports for their member country.

Member Country Development
Through our mandate and a variety of insurance solutions, ICIEC catalyzes strategic projects and improves investment attractiveness for each individual country. ICIEC supports member country development agendas by underwriting investments that contribute to their chosen strategic sectors. ICIEC’s presence as an investment partner provides a measure of reassurance and encouragement to other potential investors seeking opportunities in countries with high perceived risk. The investment projects often provide employment, enhanced, modern and ecient infrastructure, and better quality of life for citizens.
Increased Foreign Direct Investment and Investor Confidence
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an important source for economic growth and sustainability through providing capital investment into the economy that is not otherwise available from domestic sources. FDI provides job creation and knowledge transferswhen foreign companies establish subsidiaries in the host country. As foreign firms invest in OIC Member Countries they are often faced with a new, unfamiliar environment with various risks and uncertainties, including political and social risks as well as macro and microeconomic risks. ICIEC insures against many of these risks, allowing firms to expand in higher-risk countries with otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
Strategic Sector Support
ICIEC supports infrastructure development in support of strategic sectors of Member Countries, often insuring projects that help meet specific member country development agenda objectives. These projects cover a variety of sub-sectors including health, social and transportation infrastructure and energy. In addition to provid ing infrastructure development, these projects also create jobs, support the local economy via local procurement of services and equipment; and foster technology and knowledge transfer.
Improved Access to Trade Finance for LIC/LDC Member Countries
ICIEC’s risk mitigation services are especially crucial for low income and least developed countries (LIC/LDC), where market failures in regard to trade finance are known to be highest. ICIEC has provided much needed trade credit insurance to LDCs through insuring various investments, trade transactions and supporting Issuing Banks – helping these banks to access international financial markets and build their trade finance capacity. Insuring cross-border transactions in LDCs ensures that businesses are able to execute their import or export transactions smoothly where foreign buyers or sellers might view them as high risk.

Shari’ah Compliant Financial Sector Development
Financial sector health and development can be directly related to economic and member country development and is essential for trade facilitation. Countries with more developed financial sectors have an advantage in global trade as they have the capability to engage in more complex and higher-volume transactions. Mature financial sectors also facilitate full participation of consumers in the economy, creating more dynamic markets which are more likely to attract foreign direct investments.
Partnerships with Financial Institutions
Forging strategic partnerships is crucial in driving financial sector development. In addition to supporting national Export Credit Agencies, ICIEC seeks to expand its client and beneficiary base with local financial institutions. In doing so ICIEC is fulfilling both its outlined development mandate as well as SDG 17. Since its inception, ICIEC has supported numerous financial institutions through the provision of its services.
Improved Access to Islamic Financial Services
ICIEC seeks to strengthen the Islamic banking sector and demonstrate to a range of government and major financial institution actors that Islamic financing instruments and mechanisms are successful conduits for private sector development and growth. ICIEC promotes access to Islamic finance through takaful insurance and its Bank Master Policy (BMP) instrument. As the takaful credit and political risk insurer, ICIEC has pioneered a new form of export credit and investment insurance based entirely on Islamic financing, investment and insurance principles. Under its current 10- year strategy and in line with the IDBG strategy framework, ICIEC seeks to further expand its positioning to become a market maker in the takaful insurance market.

ICIEC Takaful Model

In conformity with Shari’ah principles governing Takaful, the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation (Article 28) requires the Corporation to maintain two separate funds:

The Policyholders’ Fund contains mainly the insurance contributions (i.e. premiums) and recovered claims from which insurance operation expenses are disbursed;
The Shareholders’ Fund contains the paid-up capital and accumulated reserves from which a deficit in Policyholders’ Fund may be financed through a non-interest-bearing loan.
These requirements are reflected in the structure of the financial statements of the Corporation. In addition, the Articles of Agreement do not allow the distribution of surpluses either from Shareholders’ Fund or Policyholders’ Fund until the accumulated reserves are five times the subscribed capital of the Corporation.

Shari’ah Principles: All operations of ICIEC are in accordance with Islamic Shari’ah. All regulations, rules, policies and insurance instruments are subject to close scrutiny, before their coming into force, by the Shari’ah Board of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) Group which also acts as The Shari’ah Board of ICIEC. Thus, in carrying out its operations, the Corporation observes the following principles.

Mutual co-operation of policyholders through their collective sharing of losses which any policyholder may suffer.
Distribution of the surplus that may accrue from the insurance and reinsurance operations to policyholders after meeting statutory reserve obligations.
Exclusion from cover of contracts for the sale of goods prohibited under Shari’ah, as well as interest accruing from export credit or investment loans.
Removal or amendment of terms and conditions of insured agreements in case of contradictions with Shari’ah, and;
 Investments of its own funds in accordance with Islamic principles.

ICIEC and JBIC Forge Strategic Alliance to Boost Trade and Investment					  
August 13, 2024 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia – The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC), a Shariah-based multilateral insurer and a member of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) Group, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) have signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance cooperation and support the development of trade and investment flows between ICIEC’s member states and Japan.
This strategic MoU aims to establish  a solid collaboration between ICIEC and JBIC by leveraging ICIEC’s insurance services and JBIC’s financial facilities. The partnership will facilitate transactions involving Japanese companies as exporters, EPC contractors, or investors in projects that promote the development of ICIEC’s member states, with a particular focus on Central Asia.
The collaboration is set to significantly boost trade and investment between ICIEC member states and Japan, including initiatives focused on climate action projects such as renewable energy generation.
Dr. Khalid Khalafalla, Officer-in-Charge of ICIEC said “An MoU exists between the IsDB Group and JBIC since 2016. However, the one ICIEC signed with JBIC is linked to the existing Group-level one.  He added that “this MOU formalizes and strengthens the longstanding partnership between ICIEC and JBIC and aligns with our shared vision of promoting sustainable economic development in ICIEC member states. Dr. Khalafalla continued in stating that “By leveraging our respective expertise and resources, we can enhance trade and investment opportunities for the mutual benefit of our stakeholders”.
This agreement marks a significant milestone in ICIEC’s ongoing efforts to foster economic growth and development in its member countries through strategic international partnerships.

URL: https://iciec.isdb.org/who-we-are
Content:
The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC) is a member of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) Group. ICIEC was established on 1st August 1994 (24 Safar 1415H), as an international institution with full juridical personality.
The idea for the establishment of an entity to provide investment and export credit insurance for Islamic States originated from the Agreement for the Promotion, Protection and Guarantee of Investment among Member States of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC Investment Agreement).
Article 15 of the OIC Investment Agreement authorised the Islamic Development Bank, to establish an Islamic Institution for the Guarantee of Investments operating under Shari’ah principles, to provide insurance products for investments and export credits.
Following the OIC Investment Agreement, the Board of Governors of IsDB Group, at its 16th Annual Meeting held in Tripoli, Libya, in Sha’ban 1412H (February 1992), approved the Articles of Agreement of the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC), declaring its establishment.
The mandate of the Corporation is to promote trade transactions in its member countries and to facilitate the flow of foreign direct investment into these member countries in order to contribute to the socio-economic development of its member countries. The Corporation fulfils these objectives by providing Shari’ah-compliant credit and political risk mitigation and credit enhancement insurance and reinsurance solutions.
The driving ambition behind the OIC Investment Agreement as a whole and the creation of ICIEC was to strengthen the economic relations among the Member States of the OIC on the basis of Islamic Shari’ah.

Documentary Credit Insurance Policy (DCIP)
Importer arranges issuance of LC.
The issuing bank issues an LC to the exporter’s banks.
The exporter’s bank applies to ICIEC to insure the LC. ICIEC insures the LC up to a certain percentage (e.g. 90%). The Insured is required to keep the uninsured amount on its own account.
In case of non-payment by issuing bank, the exporter’s bank submits claim and ICIEC pays compensation (90% of the loss).
ICIEC recovers from the issuing bank and pays 10% back to the exporter’s bank.
Bank Master Policy (BMP)
The exporter’s bank concludes an insurance contract with ICIEC up to a certain insured percentage (e.g. 90%) and pays the premium.
The bank provides Islamic financing to the exporter with the purchase contract as security.
In case the buyer fails to pay, the bank files a claim with ICIEC, which indemnifies the bank for up to 90% of the loss.
ICIEC recovers from the buyer and returns the 10% uninsured share to the bank.
