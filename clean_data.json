Since its first participation at COP22 in Marrakech in 2016, where ICIEC organized a high-profile panel discussion under the theme “ECA Risk Mitigation in Renewable Energy Investments,” the organization has consistently played a pivotal role in these conferences. The panel at COP22 provided a prime platform to highlight the benefits that ICIEC, in collaboration with its partners, extends to Host Countries, Investors, Lenders, and Contractors in renewable energy projects. This event marked the beginning of ICIEC's robust engagement in global climate dialogues.\nAt COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, ICIEC's presence further cemented its role as a key player in the climate action sphere. The momentum continued at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh in 2022, where ICIEC's participation was not only active but also impactful. The conference saw ICIEC co-organizing three timely side events and three fireside chats, fostering discussions and insights into critical climate issues. A significant highlight was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), focusing on delivering mark-to-market Climate Action projects in African Member States. This partnership leverages ICIEC’s expertise in de-risking solutions, demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable development in Africa.\nThe COP28 in Dubai, UAE, held on November 30, 2023, was another landmark event for ICIEC. It marked the launch of the groundbreaking Climate Change Policy, a testament to ICIEC’s dedication to mainstreaming the de-rsking of transactions and projects that combat Climate Changeinto its core operations. Furthermore, ICIEC's agreement to join the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform, managed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), underscores its proactive approach to supporting energy transition initiatives. The side events hosted by ICIEC at COP28 addressed vital topics in climate finance and mitigation, contributing valuable insights and solutions to the global climate conversation.\nLooking ahead to COP29, scheduled for November 11-24, 2024, in Azerbaijan, ICIEC is poised for active participation. As the event will be held in one of ICIEC's Member States, it presents a unique opportunity for ICIEC to showcase its initiatives, share its experiences, and further its commitment to climate action on an international stage. The conference will serve as a platform for ICIEC to continue its influential role in shaping global climate policies and strategies, particularly in areas related to renewable energy investments and sustainable development.\nICIEC's involvement in COP29 and beyond is expected to not only reinforce its position as a leader in climate risk mitigation and sustainable finance but also to foster new partnerships and collaborative efforts. The organization's ongoing engagement in these pivotal conferences is a clear indication of its resolve to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat climate change and promote a sustainable future. ICIEC's contributions and insights are anticipated to play a significant role in driving meaningful discussions and actions at COP29 and in shaping the global response to climate challenges."

To meet the ambitious yet crucial goal of eradicating hunger by 2030, acting quickly and cohesively is imperative. Recognizing this urgency, the international community has pinpointed the development of sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices as a pivotal measure for reducing global malnutrition.Consequently, we must channel increased and strategically targeted investments into infrastructure and technologies that amplify agricultural productivity and food security.\nAt ICIEC, our role as a Multilateral Development Organization compels us to take meaningful actions to bolster our Member States economic, social, and environmental well-being. In the face of the unparalleled crisis resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, our commitment to tackling emerging challenges remains stronger.\nICIEC has been a steadfast advocate for the agricultural sector among its 49 Member States for nearly three decades.

Our strategic emphasis on SDG 2 (Zero hunger) leads to this commitment, which informs ICIEC’s focus on transactions that improve food security through insured food-related activities.\nSince its inception, ICIEC’s unwavering support has translated into vital contributions, amounting to a significant USD 1.5 billion within the Agriculture sector. This considerable effort has notably boosted productivity and income for food producers, particularly in the least developed countries. The scope of our support is wide-ranging, from enabling the import of essential food commodities to empowering the mechanization systems of agriculture in member states.\nBy extending comprehensive protection to exporters dealing in agricultural goods, technologies, and equipment, ICIEC empowers them to navigate even the most challenging markets with unwavering confidence.

ICIEC covers SMBC financing to Egyptian Ministry of Finance\nAs part of ICERI, ICIEC recently extended USD 30 million in cover for a Bank Master Policy with Kuwait Finance House. The financing is being used by Egypt’s Ministry of Finance to import crude oil and refined petroleum.

The collector provides approximately 8 km of evacuation and treatment of wastewater, covering more than 10 districts of the city. The rehabilitation will significantly improve the city’s wastewater security, enhancing resilience against sanitation-related health issues for the population, especially during flood season. A more effective wastewater collector will also increase the attractiveness of the city of Dakar for foreign direct investment.\n4.ICIEC insurance supports access to energy in Tunisia\nICIEC provided USD 4.75 million toward a Bank Master Policy, allowing European based bank, CHAABI, to participate in a syndication led by ITFC. ICIEC’s cover for CHAABI is supporting the annual import of gas products to Société Tunisienne de l’Electricite et du Gaz (STEG), Tunisia’s state-owned electricity production, transport and distribution centre. This transaction is essential as it is enabling access to energy for Tunisian citizens. The coverage was provided through ICERI\n5.Supporting imports of essential commodities to Pakistan\nICIEC has provided USD 50 million in coverage under the Bank Master Policy to the Arab Investment Company for the importation of essential commodities, such as crude oil, refined products, and liquified natural gas.

Two new hospitals with a collective capacity of 400 beds will be built in the south-eastern towns of Adzope and Aboisso, bringing state of the art equipment and facilities to this underserved region. The two hospitals will employ around 600 local people and foster the development of a micro-economy in the areas surrounding them. Additionally, the project will finance five new medical units in existing hospitals across the country. The project EPC will be conducted by a Moroccan contractor, supporting the export of services from another ICIEC member country and facilitating intra-OIC trade of services and human capital between Cote d’Ivoire and Morocco. The support from ICIEC will help Côte d’Ivoire achieve its National Development Plan targets for 2016-2020 while also improving the Republic’s ability to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n7.ICIEC Extends Coverage for the Purchase of High-end Medical Equipment to Hospitals in Punjab, Pakistan\nICIEC recently extended USD 2.3 million, the extent of the Corporation’s line limit, in non-payment insurance to support the supply and installation of state-of-the-art CT scan equipment to District Headquarters hospitals in Punjab, Pakistan. This project will greatly assist the Pakistani healthcare sector in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic by providing doctors with a more cost effective and accurate method for diagnosing patients. The project was funded as part of an ongoing program with the Government of Punjab to improve the lack of essential medical diagnostic equipment in the province. ICIEC’s involvement in the transaction also directly supports the Punjab Health Reforms Roadmap, initiated in April 2014, to improve the quality of healthcare facilities in Pakistan’s most populous province.\n8.ICIEC Cover Enables the Construction and Rehabilitation of Schools in Côte d’Ivoire\nICIEC has provided EUR 20 million in Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligation cover against the non-payment of a loan facility provided to the Government of Côte d’Ivoire.

The program aims to mitigate poverty and illiteracy by enabling as many children as possible to have access to quality education.\n9.ICIEC provides cover for financing of essential imports to Nigeria in response to COVID-19\nICIEC has provided USD 12.5 million in cover, issuing the Corporation’s first ever BMP Murabaha to BMCE Bank of Africa Morocco in support of its financing for a Nigerian bank. ICIEC’s support allowed for the urgent financing to secure essential imports of food and refined oil to Nigeria, helping to offset the social and economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ICIEC has played a crucial role in facilitating trade flow and reinforcing trust, directly supporting banks and private sector resilience through the crisis.\n10.ICIEC support provides essential commodities to the Government of Egypt\nICIEC has provided USD 16 million under a Documentary Credit Insurance Policy to French international bank, Société Générale, for the importation of essential commodities to Egypt. ICIEC’s contribution is essential as the facility was allocated in response to the Government of Egypt’s call to the international market for a more secure and steady supply of strategic commodities to help Egypt in the fight against the economic and social impact of COVID-19.\n11.Securing essential imports of wheat to enhance food security in Bangladesh\nICIEC is supplying USD 17.1 million in coverage under ICERI to one of the leading private commercial banks in Bangladesh, the State Bank of India (SBI).

Human development efforts from ICIEC include underwriting projects that contribute to access to basic infrastructure and services, including health, nutrition, education and sanitation. Promoting access to these services inherently improves the well-being of and quality of life for member country citizens. In turn, these healthier populations are more productive and are better enabled to contribute back into their country’s economy.\nJob Creation\nICIEC recognizes the opportunities presented by the growing working age population within OIC countries and the job creation concerns they face. Through supporting FDI and exporters and facilitating trade, ICIEC contributes to both creating new jobs and sustaining existing ones. As companies increase their exports, they scale up operations, leading to labor demand on the economy and more employment opportunities. ICIEC emphasizes supporting labor- intensive sectors where significant employment opportunities can be created.\nAccess to Infrastructure\nImproving access to infrastructure is among the top priorities for ICIEC’s development impact. ICIEC’s multilateral and preferred creditor status make it an attractive partner for investors and stakeholders embarking on such projects. ICIEC also provides much needed insurance for financing large development projects, particularly in high risk investment countries where mobilizing large sources of finance can be risky without adequate mitigants.\nAccess to Basic Social Services\nICIEC is also committed to improving access to basic social services particularly health and water services. Supporting access to high quality health care promotes healthier lives for all OIC Member Countries’ citizens leading to higher productivity and overall economic growth. Improving access to water services is crucial for most OIC countries that have scarce water resources and are even more susceptible with climate change.\nAccess To Clean Water In Abidjan\nSharjah Waste To Energy Project\nICIEC Cover Enables the Construction and Rehabilitation of Côte d’Ivoire Schools\nThe ICIEC-ISFD Covid Emergency Response Program\nSupporting rural access to education and medical facilities in Senegal\nEnhancing Access to essential internet services in Indonesia"

The ratification of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement signaled the strong commitment African countries have towards open trade. The free trade area has an ambition to create a unified continental market estimated at USD 3 trillion with over 1 billion people. However, to translate the AfCFTA from a trade agreement into a thriving free trade area will require significant financial resource mobilization to facilitate exports.\nTo realize the tremendous potential in the AfCFTA, given the existing high investment risk, will require the participation of institutions that offer investment insurance such as ICIEC. The insurance services offered will be crucial for the success of the AfCFTA in two main ways.\nFirst, these investment insurance institutions provide much needed insurance to cover the political and commercial risks that might affect trade transactions. This insurance coverage provides investors with confidence that if the transaction does not follow through, they can at least get their initial investment back. This type of insurance will encourage more first mover investors in the AfCFTA. Second, the capacity building offered by ICIEC will be critical in building national institutions that support exports such as national Export Credit Agencies (ECA’s) and banks. Capacity building is essential in equipping these export-enabling institutions with the financial resources and technical capacity needed to facilitate exports in the AfCFTA.\nAs AfCFTA signatories begin to negotiate the trade agreement they should also keep in mind that investment insurance will be the cornerstone in building an inclusive and thriving free trade area that will benefit all member states."

Daily 10-hour blackouts were common at the peak of the crisis in the summer of 2013, and in 2014 and 2015, power was cut to heavy industry, reducing Egypt’s private sector competitiveness.\nIn 2015, the Egyptian Government introduced an emergency plan to double power generation capacity by 2020. ICIEC has underwritten the construction of gas power plants in Assiut, West Damietta Port Said, Hurgada and Sharm El Sheikh with a totaled installed capacity of 2,672MW. This served to stabilize the power grid and secure the base load. By providing stable electricity supplies to large industries with high voltage electricity needs, this investment will increase Egypt’s competitiveness.\nThe government’s energy plan calls for Egypt to produce at least 20% of its energy from renewables by 2022 and as much as 40% by 2035 up from 3%. The  Benban Solar Complex, a 1.8GW project, consists of 30 separate solar plants being developed by different companies at a total cost of USD 4 billion and will generate enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.

As such, ICIEC understands its vital role in helping to drive investment into climate-resilient infrastructure in these member countries and is working consistently to improve its capacity as a climate finance provider. In addition to its covering of climate-resilient projects, ICIEC has begun building partnerships which will allow the Corporation to leverage its products more effectively and to crowd in private sector capital for climate related projects. The Corporation has also begun developing products tailored specifically for catalyzing investment towards climate-resilient projects.\nSpecifically, ICIEC introduced its Green Sukuk Insurance Policy, aimed at allowing Sukuk issuers to better attract capital for “green” projects. The product will be crucial for issuers in ICIEC’s vulnerable developing countries which may struggle with poor credit ratings. Fostering its climate finance partnerships, ICIEC signed an MoU with the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), aimed at facilitating sustainable energy investment into Morocco. Finally, ICIEC built up its climate finance capacity by having its representatives attend events aimed at strengthening the renewable energy sector. To this end, ICIEC representatives attended the North African Renewable Energy Summit 2019 and the 5th International Renewable Energy Agency Policy Day.

ICIEC’s support to exporters and banks in facilitating trade between Member Countries and with the rest of the world. ICIEC also aims to facilitate and increase intra-OIC exports, encouraging businesses to take advantage of the diverse resources in Member Countries.\nEnhanced Access to Markets\nAccessing new markets can be daunting for exporters for a myriad of reasons including political risk and lack of available credit data. This perceived risk can lead to adverse effects on an exporter’s growth prospects. ICIEC’s products provide exporters with assurance when entering new and potentially riskier markets. ICIEC’s insurance is not only useful to firms seeking to access new markets but also for firms looking to increase exports and service delivery to their existing markets. Expansion in existing markets can also entail risks given the various economic, political and social uncertainties. The insurance ICIEC provides gives these firms the protection they need to expand their market share.\nSME Integration into Export Markets/Value Chains\nSMEs play a significant role in economic development and job creation both in developed and developing countries. However, in most OIC member countries,SMEs continue to face significant financing gaps. ICIEC has played a leading role in supporting SMEs in OIC Member Countries to integrate in export markets and value chains through underwriting SME loan facilities or insuring Letters of Credit for the importation of capital goods by SMEs to become more productive and competitive.\nIncreased Capacity of National ECAs\nMany member countries have embarked on establishing their own national Export Credit Agencies (ECAs), often starting off with limited insurance and technical capacities—especially in developing countries. ICIEC provides capacity building and financial services to support these endeavours, closely cooperates with them, and provides additional insurance capacity through facultative and treaty re-insurance mechanisms. Increasing the capabilities of these ECAs allows them to provide support to businesses in parallel with ICIEC’s offerings, facilitating even more exports for their member country.\nProject Highlights\nInsurance As The Facilitator To Unlocking Market Access To The AfCFTA\nFostering Inclusive Growth in Türkiye\nSupporting Greater Capacity and New Jobs in the Egyptian Maritime Industry\nReinsurance increases insurance capacity for Indonesian ECAs"

ICIEC was established on 1st August 1994 (24 Safar 1415H), as an international institution with full juridical personality.\nThe idea for the establishment of an entity to provide investment and export credit insurance for Islamic States originated from the Agreement for the Promotion, Protection and Guarantee of Investment among Member States of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC Investment Agreement).\nArticle 15 of the OIC Investment Agreement authorised the Islamic Development Bank, to establish an Islamic Institution for the Guarantee of Investments operating under Shari’ah principles, to provide insurance products for investments and export credits.\nFollowing the OIC Investment Agreement, the Board of Governors of IsDB Group, at its 16th Annual Meeting held in Tripoli, Libya, in Sha’ban 1412H (February 1992), approved the Articles of Agreement of the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC), declaring its establishment.\nThe mandate of the Corporation is to promote trade transactions in its member countries and to facilitate the flow of foreign direct investment into these member countries in order to contribute to the socio-economic development of its member countries. The Corporation fulfils these objectives by providing Shari’ah-compliant credit and political risk mitigation and credit enhancement insurance and reinsurance solutions.\nThe driving ambition behind the OIC Investment Agreement as a whole and the creation of ICIEC was to strengthen the economic relations among the Member States of the OIC on the basis of Islamic Shari’ah."
